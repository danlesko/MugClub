# Mug Club 

This was a side project that I created for The White Oak Tavern. It takes in a person's first and last name and responds with their corresponding mug club number. This was used to speed up the retrieval process of one's mug club card upon their arrival to the restaurant, which helped the servers of the restaurant significantly. Previously the cards were stored in alphabetical order corresponding to the first letter of a person's last name. However, further alphabetization beyond the first letter of the last name was too complicated. I thought it would be easier to store the cards in numerical order as every member is assigned a id number upon their signing up to the club. If one can easily discover one's mug club number by typing in their first and / or last name into a database, retrieval of the card is sped up significantly. It also makes returning the card easier as organizing a card straight to it's intended numerical order is easier than alphabetical order.
